# JavaFX-Tetris
Tetris built using JavaFX, no third party libraries needed.

Tetris, the classic game in which the player moves blocks down the screen with the aim of completing lines.

This version os very basic in terms of the user interface, with that said it has been built in such a way that within the code each block of the tetrino, I.e. four blocks per tetrino, is minipulatable.

Within future updates, I will add a game menu, updated i ngame user interface and more.
